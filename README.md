# Potluck Planner

This is the marketing page for the Potluck Planner app project for Lambda School Build Week 1

My name is Eric Richards and I designed and coded the home-page and the about-us page.

Since there are quite a few repeating design styles throughout each page, I created several mixins to cut down on the repeating lines of code. They can all be found in the mixins.less folder.

All of the colors used in the website can be found in the variables.less folder for reference.

There is also a mobile query in the variables.less folder with a breakpoint of 500px.

A separate img folder was created to contain all of the images used within the site. All of the non-team member images were taken from unsplash.com.

There is a favicon.ico placed in the root folder and referenced in the head of the index.html document that gives the page its tab logo.
